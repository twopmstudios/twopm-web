                h1 Welcome to the Songlands
                p <strong>The Fae</strong> have watched over this world since time eternal, gently steering destiny along its tracks. To be honest though, there's not <em>that</em> much to do. Nothing of any Fae-level importance has happened in hundreds of years... Until now. 

                p Introducing "<strong>The Bard</strong>", an egomaniacal adventurer determined to leave their mark on history. Somehow <strong>The Bard</strong> has been invited to the annual <strong>WizardChess</strong> tournament, a contrived magical battle hosted by the Fae, for the Fae. 

                p The game? A deckbuilding chess-like that's simple to pick up but near impossible to master. 

                p And the prize? A boon from the <strong>FaeQueen</strong> herself.

                p Step into the shoes of <strong>The Bard</strong>, master <strong>WizardChess</strong> and scribble your name all over history. <strong>The Song of The Fae</strong> is yet to be written.

                h1 Key Features
                ul
                    li Deeply Strategic: it's chess meets turn-based tactics, one move can (and will) change the entire game.
                    li Build your Army: recruit, sacrifice, trade and gamble your units away to create the ultimate build.
                    li Battle the Fae: use the power of board games to defeat the Fae in unique boss battles.
                    li Massively Replayable: every run in SoTF is procedurally generated, down to the encounters, enemies, units, statistics and even the AI. 

                p 
                    strong The game is still in development and we plan to continue adding content for some time. The quality ands cope of this build are not representative of final game. Regardless, we've got plenty to show you.

                h1 The Team
                p <a href="/">TwoPM</a> consists of Ben Follington (<a href="https://twitter.com/vivavolt">@vivavolt</a>) and Ricky James (<a href="https://twitter.com/iammonshushu">@iammonshushu</a>), both based in Queensland, Australia. We've been best friends for about 15 years and have been making games for almost as long. We both have jobs and can only work on games during nights and weekends so we like to build projects both patiently and strategically. 

                p 
                    em  Financial support of SoTF or any of our other work will allow us to dedicate more time to game development and deliver content faster.
